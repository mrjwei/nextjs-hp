LingoBun is deliberately calm, focused, and serious about learning. Without a logo that reflected those values, the experience felt incomplete. So as the product started to take shape, I decided to design a visual identity for it.

## Expectations: AI as a Shortcut

By this point, I had already had some genuinely positive experiences using AI tools in development work, especially for code generation and exploration. They were fast, iterative, and often surprisingly helpful. Naturally, I expected a similar outcome for logo design.

The brief was simple:

- Combine the metaphors of **"Lingo" (language)** and **"Bun" (bunny)**
- Keep it modern, minimal, and scalable
- Icon + workmark (not icon-only or text-only)

I tried multiple AI tools, experimented with different prompt styles, and went through several rounds of refinement.

## Reality: AI Logos Fell Short

The results were disappointing. Not because they were unusable in a strict sense, but because **they didn't align with the values of the product** and **were of poor quality in general**.

Most of the generated logos suffered from these issues:

- Metaphors were literal but not integrated or abstracted
- Shapes felt arbitrary rather than intentional or precise
- Visual balance was inconsistent
- Details didn't survive downscaling

For a product that's explicitly about deliberate practice and clarity, the logo felt misaligned. It looked generated, not designed.

## Going Back to First Principles

Eventually, I stopped prompting and opened [Affinity](https://www.affinity.studio/). I used a geometric construction to combine the two metaphors:

- A speech bubble to represent language and communication
- A bunny silhouette abstracted into a minimal, friendly form

Every curve and angle was **intentional**. The geometry isn't visible to the user, but it creates **a sense of balance and order**. This precision is not accidental. It mirrors one of LingoBun's core ideas: learning doesn't have to be flashy to be effective.

## Key Takeaways

The experience highlighted some limitations of AI tools in supporting design practice. I realised that AI could be useful for exploring ideas and visual directions, but when it came to making sensible design decisions, it fell short.

The logo was shaped by **constraints**, **trade-offs**, and **intent**. That's still a very **human** process.
