The `argsort` method in numpy returns an array of indices that can be used to sort the array itself or another array. At first, its mechanism might feel a little confusing, but the idea is both powerful and straightforward once you understand how it works and why we need it.

## An Array of Indices

Take this example:

```
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([10, 15, 3])
sorted_indices = np.argsort(arr)
print(sorted_indices)
```

This outputs:

```
[2 0 1]
```

- 2 means the smallest element (3) is at index 2.
- 0 means the next element in sorted order (10) is at index 0.
- 1 means the last element (15) is at index 1.

So instead of giving us the sorted array, `argsort` tells us **the positions of the sorted values in the original array**.

## Why Use argsort Instead of Just Sorting?

You may wonder why not just call `np.sort` and be done with it? The difference is that `argsort` preserves **order information**. This becomes useful when you want to sort **related arrays together**.

For example:

```
fruits = np.array(['orange', 'apple', 'banana'])
prices = np.array([1.5, 2.5, 1.0])
```

We want to sort `prices` in ascending order and apply the same ordering to `fruits`:

```
indices = np.argsort(prices)
sorted_prices = prices[indices]
sorted_fruits = fruits[indices]
print(sorted_prices)
print(sorted_fruits)
```

This outputs:

```
[1.  1.5 2.5]
['banana' 'orange' 'apple']
```

Here, `argsort` gave us the index order to sort both arrays consistently. That way, `prices` and `fruits` stay aligned.

## Sorting Higher-Dimensional Arrays

`argsort` works with arrays of any number of dimensions. By default, it sorts along the last axis (axis=-1), but you can specify another axis if needed.

Example with a 3D array:

```
arr_3d = np.array([
    [[3, 1, 2],
     [9, 6, 4]],
    [[7, 5, 8],
     [0, 2, 1]]
])

print(np.argsort(arr_3d, axis=-1))
```

It outputs:

```
[[[1 2 0]
  [2 1 0]]
 [[1 2 0]
  [0 2 1]]]
```

Each sub-array gets sorted independently along the last axis (columns, in this case).
## Conclusion

`numpy` comes with many specialized methods that can feel unintuitive at first glance. But once you see their purpose, they become simple and powerful tools.

`argsort` is one of those methods:  instead of just sorting values, it gives you the ordering information, which is invaluable when you need to sort related arrays or keep track of ranks and positions.
