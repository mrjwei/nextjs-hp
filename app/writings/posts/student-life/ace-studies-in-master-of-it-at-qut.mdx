The second semester in Master of IT at QUT has begun. Reflecting on my first one, I learned so much—though the process wasn't always smooth. I made mistakes and faced struggles from time to time, but I still managed to achieve high academic performance.

Thus, in this article, I want to share my first-hand experience and practical advice for succeeding in this course and beyond. This may be especially helpful for first-year postgraduates.

## Focus on Process, Not Grades

It's often said that money is a by-product of professional success. Similarly, in academia, grades are the by-product of genuine learning. They're an important indicator of achievement, but they shouldn't be the ultimate goal.

Instead, I chose to focus on the process of learning. Beyond scheduled coursework, I invested a significant amount of time studying relevant subjects, diving deeper into interesting topics that were not covered in detail in class, and building self-initiated projects to strengthen my learning outcomes (more on this later).

For example, in the *Computer System and Security* unit, I read all the optional security articles shared by the tutor, gaining a broader understanding of the global cybersecurity landscape and emerging technologies that could either strengthen or undermine security. In another unit, *Rapid Web Development with Database*, I treated the group assignment like a real-world team project, applying project management techniques I'd learned through work experience. With my background in UX design, we ensured our web app was not just functional, but also user-friendly and professional-looking.

Thanks to this process-focused approach, I earned High Distinctions in all the units I enrolled in. But more importantly, I **enjoyed** the journey rather than suffering through it. That made the time and effort I put into my studies especially meaningful and rewarding.

## Attendance Matters

Attending lectures and tutorials as often as I could turned out to be crucial. While I switched to online versions of a couple of units to better manage my study-work balance, I still showed up to every single lecture and tutorial session—online or in person.

I found that showing up helped me:

- Stay disciplined by organizing daily tasks more effectively
- Be more productive, through interaction with fellow students and tutors
- Better understand assignment and exam requirements, which naturally improved my results—even though grades weren't my main focus

## Engagement Is Key

Even more important than attendance is **engagement**—how actively you participate in academic activities like tutorials, assignments, and side projects.

Unfortunately, I've seen students attend lectures and tutorials but fail to make the most of them. Some sleep through, others chat throughout, and many just passively listen.

It's understandable—maybe the lecture isn't that interesting, maybe you're tired, or maybe you're juggling other priorities. But as future IT professionals, we must learn to adapt and stay productive regardless of the situation.

Some strategies that helped me stay engaged, especially when I was strugging to concentrate:

- Reviewing past lectures or tutorials materials (saves time when preparing for exams)
- Attempting tutorial questions in advance
- Learning something different but related that sparked my curiosity
- Drafting blog posts on topics we were studying
- Asking questions during class whenever I could

## Take Quality Notes

The difference between a note and a *quality* note is whether you process the information before writing it down.

It is easy to just copy what's on the lecture slides, but this is often ineffective—you're not actually *learning*, and concepts won't stick without active engagement.

A better approach is to *summarize* the content in your own words. Even better? Add your own thoughts, opinions, or questions so that you can dig deeper later or ask your tutor. I also like adding images and diagrams—they often explain complex ideas better than text.

## Build, Build, and Build

I find it incredibly exciting and rewarding to brainstorm ideas and apply what I've learned to real-world problems. I dedicate a significant amount of my time after class to building side projects. This has helped me:

1. Deepen and broaden my knowledge
2. Develop a habit of taking action quickly
3. Foster an entrepreneurial mindset

I'm now planning to invite other like-minded students to collaborate. It's a great way to connect, learn, and grow together.

## Conclusion

Coursework in the Master of IT at QUT is intensive. But with the right mindset and a consistent investment of time and effort—both inside and outside class—students *can* succeed.

The key is to find a way to enjoy the learning process, challenge yourself through side projects, and build meaningful connections along the way.
