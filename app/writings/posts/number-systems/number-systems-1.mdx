The same number can be represented in different ways using different number systems. Broadly speaking, number systems fall into two categories: **position-independent** and **position-dependent** systems.

## Position-Independent Number Systems

In a position-independent number system, the value of a symbol remains constant regardless of its position in the sequence. A classic example is the _Roman numeral system_.

In this system, symbols such as I, V and X always represent the same values: 1, 5, and 10 respectively. For example:

- IV
- VI

In both cases, **I** is worth 1 and **V** is worth 5, regardless of their position. The interpretation of the entire number may change due to ordering, but the value of each symbol does not.

## Position-Dependent Number Systems

Modern number systems, such as decimal and binary, are position-dependent. This means the value of a digit depends on its position in the number.

Take the decimal number 35, for instance. The 3 here represents 3 \* 10 = 30 because it is in the tens place. However, in 23, the 3 represents just 3, as it is in the units place.

This is in stark contrast to the Roman system, where the value of V remains 5 in both IV and VI, regardless of its position.

## Advantages of Position-Dependent Number Systems

Ancient position-independent systems like the Roman numerals were sufficient for representing small numbers but lacked scalability and made arithmetic operations difficult.

Position-dependent systems are:

- **Scalable**. They can represent very large or very small numbers compactly by leveraging positional magnitude.
- **Efficient for computation**. They are better suited for arithmetic operations, especially by machines.
- **Expressive**. A number like **1987** in decimal becomes **MCMLXXXVII** in Roman numeralsâ€”long and difficult to interpret.
- **Zero-inclusive**. Unlike the Roman numeral system, modern number systems include zero, a critical component for both arithmetic and placeholding.
