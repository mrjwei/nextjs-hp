A common challenge when handling binaries is how to represent signed numbers in a way that is both machine- and human-friendly.

## Traditional Approaches

One traditional approach to represent signed integers is the **sign-magnitude** method. Numbers such as +6 and -6 can be represented in 4 bits as:

```bash
0110  # +6 (0 for positive)
1110  # -6 (1 for negative)
```

The most significant bit is reserved for the sign, while the remaining bits represent the magnitude. However, there are a few notable drawbacks with this approach:

1. There are two representations of zero. For example, in a 4-bit system, zero can be represented as either 0000 (+0) or 1000 (−0).
2. The two representations of zero reflect another issue with the sign-magnitude approach—it makes arithmetic calculations complex. First, computers require extra logic to ensure that the different representations of zero are treated as equal. More importantly, since the binary representation of a number does not align with its magnitude, arithmetic comparisons and calculations cannot be performed in a regular manner—you would get incorrect results unless special logic is applied. For example, adding +5 and -5 using sign-magnitude in a 4-bit system results in:

```bash
  0101
+ 1101
-------
 10010  # Incorrect because it is not zero
```

Another approach is the **one’s complement** notation. _Complement_ essentially means the number required to reach a fixed total. For example, the complement of 9 to reach 10 is 1. “One” here refers to the fact that the fixed total is 2<sup>n</sup> − 1, which in binary is a string of all 1s.

With this method, the negative counterpart of a positive number is produced by flipping all the bits of the positive number. Take +6 and -6 for example:

```bash
0110  # +6
1001  # -6
```

However, the one’s complement method does not solve the issues with sign-magnitude. It still results in two representations of zero, and arithmetic operations remain awkward.

## Two’s Complement Notation

The two’s complement notation has many advantages over traditional approaches, making it the standard way to represent signed integers in modern computing.

Rather than complementing a fixed value of all 1s, two’s complement represents the negative of a number as its complement with respect to 2<sup>n</sup>. Specifically, in an n-bit system, the total range spans −2<sup>n-1</sup> to 2<sup>n-1</sup> − 1.

### How It Works

Two’s complement is a **fixed-width** representation, meaning it can only represent a limited range of integers. For instance, in 4-bit two’s complement, the representable range is from −8 to +7.

<Table
  data={{
    headers: ["Binary", "Decimal"],
    rows: [
      ["0000", "0"],
      ["0001", "1"],
      ["0010", "2"],
      ["0011", "3"],
      ["0100", "4"],
      ["0101", "5"],
      ["0110", "6"],
      ["0111", "7"],
      ["1000", "-8"],
      ["1001", "-7"],
      ["1010", "-6"],
      ["1011", "-5"],
      ["1100", "-4"],
      ["1101", "-3"],
      ["1110", "-2"],
      ["1111", "-1"],
    ],
  }}
/>

Positive integers are represented in normal binary form, while negative integers are represented using the following steps:

1. Find the binary representation of the number’s absolute value (its positive counterpart).
2. Flip each bit (i.e., 0s become 1s, and 1s become 0s).
3. Add 1 to the result.

Take −3 as an example in a 4-bit system:

```bash
# Step 1: Binary of +3
0011

# Step 2: Flip bits
1100

# Step 3: Add 1
1101
```

So, −3 is represented as 1101.

### Why Adding 1?

This is the key step that makes the complement relative to a power of 2. In the previous example, without the +1, −3 would be 1100, and adding +3 would result in 1111, which is −1, not 0. If we treated 1111 as 0, we would end up with **two representations of zero** again—just like one’s complement.

By adding 1 to the flipped bits, we ensure that adding a number and its two’s complement always yields zero, with **only one unique representation of zero**. For example:

```bash
  0101  # +5
+ 1011  # −5
-------
 10000  # The leftmost carry is discarded—result is 0000
```

This example also highlights a big advantage of two’s complement: subtractions can be performed as additions of negative numbers, which simplifies arithmetic logic and makes hardware more efficient.
