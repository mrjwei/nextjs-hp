## What is ECC

**Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that is gaining popularity due to its **strong security** and **smaller key sizes** compared to other common algorithms like [RSA](/writings/common-asymmetric-algorithms-rsa).

It is especially suitable for **key exchange** and is often combined with symmetric algorithms like [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) to secure information transmission. ECC is widely used in technologies and services like [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) and [Signal](https://signal.org/).

## How Does ECC Work

In essence, ECC works by **deriving a third point from two known points** on a curve. The key components of the algorithm are:

- An elliptic curve defined by a cubic equation in this form: y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b. The curve is symmetric across the x-axis.
- A random starting point, `G`, on the curve, which is agreed upon by both parties.

The most difficult part to grasp is **how a third point is derived**. This is achieved through what is called **scalar multiplication**.

### Scalar Multiplication

Let's say there is a point `H` on an elliptic curve, and `H = G + G + G + ...`, then `H` is a **scalar multiple** of `G`. Mathmatically, we express `H` as:

`H = a・G`

Where `a` is an integer scalar.

> Scalar multiplication is entirely different from traditional arithmetic addition. If `G = (0, 1)`, we cannot compute `2G` as:
>
> ❌`2G = (0+0, 1+1) = (0, 2)`

Instead, we use a special geometric method of _point addition_ to derive the new point. Here is an example using the curve y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> - x + 1 and the starting point `G = (0, 1)` to compute `3G`.

#### Step 1: Derive 2G

Normally, to add two points, we draw a line between them, find the third point of intersection with the curve, and reflect it across the x-axis.

When calculating `2G = G + G`, we draw the **tangent line** at `G` (since the two points are the same), find its intersection with the curve, and reflect that point to get `2G`.

#### Step 2: Derive 3G

Now, draw a line through `G` and `2G`, find the third point of intersection with the curve, and reflect it across the x-axis to obtain `3G`.

### A Complete Example

Now that we understand how scalar multiplication works, we can walk through how ECC is used to generate keys and create a shared secret for secure message transmission.

#### Step 1: Agree on a Curve and Point

Suppose Alice and Bob want to exchange keys using ECC. First, they agree on the elliptic curve and a base point on the curve, `G`.

#### Step 2: Choose Private Keys

Alice and Bob each select a random integer, `a` and `b`, as their **private keys**.

#### Step 3: Compute Public Keys

They then compute their **public keys**, `A` and `B`, using scalar multiplication:

```
A = a・G
B = b・G
```

#### Step 4: Derive a Shared Secret

Each party uses their private key and the other’s public key to compute the **shared secret**:

`S = a・B = b・A = a・b・G`

This works because of the associative property of ECC point multiplication.

#### Step 5: Derive a Symmetric Key

Since ECC is typically used for **key exchange**, not for encrypting actual messages, the shared point `S` is passed through a **Key Derivation Function (KDF)**—such as SHA-256—to derive a symmetric key:

<pre>
  <code>
    Key = KDF(S<sub>x</sub>)
  </code>
</pre>

Where S<sub>x</sub> is the x-coordinate of the shared point.

Alice and Bob now use the derived symmetric key with a fast symmetric algorithm like AES to encrypt and decrypt their actual messages.

## Why Is ECC Popular

### Strong Security

ECC’s security relies on a difficult mathematical problem called the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**, which asks:

> Given a point `G` and another point `a・G`, can you determine `a`?

The answer is: not feasibly. While scalar multiplication is easy, reversing it to recover the private key is computationally infeasible, even with powerful hardware.

### High Performance

ECC can achieve the **same level of security as RSA but with much smaller key sizes**.

This makes ECC **faster and less resource-intensive**, which is especially important for mobile devices and low-power systems.

## Conclusion

Elliptic Curve Cryptography is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption methods today due to its **strong security** and **high efficiency**. Major operating systems, web browsers, and secure messaging apps rely on ECC—and it is especially valuable for **resource-constrained devices** like smartphones, wearables, and IoT sensors.
