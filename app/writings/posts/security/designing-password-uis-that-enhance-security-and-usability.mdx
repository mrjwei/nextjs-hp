## The Problems

Many sign-up forms still use a password UI pattern like this:

<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/designing-password-uis-that-enhance-security-and-usability/password_1.png"
    alt="password inputs without revealing option and that do not allow
    copy-and-paste for confirmation"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>

    copy-and-paste for confirmation
  </figcaption>
</figure>

While this may seem secure at first glance, this approach is **problematic**, because:

1. **It encourages weak passwords.**
   Users often create short, easy-to-remember passwords to avoid mistyping — especially when they’re forced to confirm it.

2. **It leads to password reuse.**
   Because memorizing strong, unique passwords is hard, users tend to reuse the same ones across multiple accounts.

3. **It increases the chance of errors.**
   If a user mistypes the password in the confirmation box but can’t see what they wrote, it’s nearly impossible to troubleshoot — especially if the UI doesn’t allow them to reveal the password.

       alt="hard to toubleshoot without the option to reveal the password"
       style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
     />
     <figcaption>

   </figure>
4. **It disables copy-paste.**
   Many UIs block pasting into the confirmation field, assuming this improves security. In reality, it just breaks compatibility with password managers and reduces accessibility.

5. **It drives users away.**
   Frustrated users may abandon the registration process altogether — a clear UX failure.

## The Rise of Password Managers

Modern **password managers** (like Google Password Manager) offer a far safer and more user-friendly approach. They:

- Generate strong passwords.
- Store them securely.
- Auto-fill credentials without user input.

As these tools become standard, **UI design must evolve** to support this shift toward secure automation — not fight against it.

## Recommended Improvements

To make your password input form both **secure and user-friendly**, apply the following updates:

1. **Allow copy-paste** in all password fields — especially the confirmation field, if you use one.
2. **Provide a show/hide toggle** for each password input.
3. **Minimize friction** by aligning with how people actually manage passwords today.

## (Update) Confirm Password Field Is Unnecessary

Many design systems now recommend removing the “Confirm Password” field altogether. For example:

- The [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/password-input/) advises **not** using a confirmation field, as it adds unnecessary friction and cognitive burden.

- The [WCAG 2.2 success criterion on accessible authentication](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum) states that password inputs **must allow copy and paste** to reduce user cognitive burden.
- In short, forcing users to confirm a password — without paste support or visibility — not only harms UX but also fails accessibility standards.

## Final Recommendations

To balance security, accessibility, and user experience:

1. Remove the "Confirm Password" field altogether.
2. Provide a password visibility toggle (default to hidden).
3. Support password managers by allowing pasting into all fields.
4. Offer passkey-based authentication as a future-proof option (if possible).

## Conclusion

Security is not only about strong algorithms — it starts with thoughtful, inclusive **user interface design**. By removing unnecessary friction and aligning UI with modern tools like password managers and passkeys, we help users stay secure without making the authentication process harder for them.
