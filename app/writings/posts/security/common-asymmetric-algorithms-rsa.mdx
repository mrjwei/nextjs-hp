## What is RSA

**Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA)** is one of the most well-known algorithms for **asymmetric cryptography**. It uses a **public key** for encryption and a corresponding **private key** for decryption. Each key consists of a pair of large integers.

## How Does RSA Work

### Step 1: Generate a Shared Component

Choose **two large prime numbers**, p and q. The size of these primes is crucial for ensuring strong security. For demonstration, we will use small primes:

```
p=7
q=19
```

Compute their product:

```
n = p * q = 7 * 19 = 133
```

This value `n` is used in both the public and private keys.

### Step 2: Generate the Public Exponent

Calculate [Euler's totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function):

```
Φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 6 * 18 = 108
```

Choose an integer `e` such that:

- `1<e<Φ(n)`
- `gcd(e, Φ(n)) = 1` (i.e. `e` and `Φ(n)`are coprime)

Let's choose `e = 25`.
Then the **public key** is:

```
(e, n) = (25, 133)
```

### Step 3: Generate the Private Exponent

Now we find `d`, the [modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of `e` mod `Φ(n)` such that:

```
e * d ≡ 1 mod Φ(n)
```

Here, `d = 13` works, since:

```
25 × 13 = 325 ≡ 1 mod 108
```

Thus, the **private key** is:

```
(d, n) = (13, 133)
```

### Step 4: Encrypt the Message

Let the plaintext message be `m = 5`. To encrypt it:

<pre>
  <code>
    c = m<sup>e</sup> mod n = 5<sup>25</sup> mod 133 = 54
  </code>
</pre>

### Step 5: Decrypt the Message

To decrypt the ciphertext:

<pre>
  <code>
    m = c<sup>d</sup> mod n = 54<sup>13</sup> mod 133 = 5
  </code>
</pre>

This recovers the original message.

> The mathmatical basis for RSA is [Euler's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem), which ensures that modular exponentiation with the public and private keys are inverse operations under modulo `n`.

## Security and Performance Considerations

The security of RSA depends on the **difficulty of factoring very large numbers**. With current classical computing power, this remains computationally expensive for sufficiently large key sizes (e.g., 2048 or 4096 bits).

However, quantum computing introduces new risks through advanced algorithms, potentially breaking RSA.

Additionally, RSA’s performance is relatively slow due to the size of keys and the complexity of the exponentiation. It is not suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.

For these reasons, [Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) is growing in populartiy. It offers comparable or stronger security with smaller key sizes, leading to better performance.
