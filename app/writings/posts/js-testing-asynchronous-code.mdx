Building on my previous article, [Testing Asynchronously Thrown Errors in Javascript](/js-testing-asynchronously-thrown-errors), I want to explore the broader topic of testing asynchronous code in JavaScript. Asynchronous programming is a cornerstone of JavaScript, and testing it effectively is a critical skill for any developer.

## Three Options for Testing Asynchronous Code

There are three main approaches to testing asynchronous code in JavaScript:

- Using promises
- Using async/await
- Using callbacks

In this article, I will illustrate each approach using examples from the [Test-Driven Development for JavaScript](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/test-driven-development-for/9780137864591/) course.

The production code we will test is a simple doTask function that simulates a task with random success or failure after a delay:

```javascript
function doTask(taskNumber, randomNumber) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (randomNumber < 0.5) resolve(`Task ${taskNumber} resolved`)
      else reject(`Task ${taskNumber} rejected`)
    }, randomNumber * 5000)
  })
}
```

### Using Promises

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),

> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

For a task that resolves, we can place our matcher in the then method:

```javascript
test("task resolves if value < 0.5", () => {
  return doTask(1, 0.3).then((data) => {
    expect(data).toBe("Task 1 resolved")
  })
})
```

When testing rejection, it’s essential to add `expect.assertions(n)` to ensure the test verifies the expected number of assertions. Without this, the test could falsely pass if the promise unexpectedly resolves:

```javascript
test("task rejects if value >= 0.5", () => {
  expect.assertions(1)
  return doTask(1, 0.5).catch((err) => {
    expect(err).toBe("Task 1 rejected")
  })
})
```

Jest provides `resolves` and `rejects` matchers for simpler syntax when working with promises, so we can use these too:

```javascript
test("task resolves if value < 0.5", () => {
  return expect(doTask(1, 0.3)).resolves.toBe("Task 1 resolved")
})
```

<br />

```javascript
test("task rejects if value >= 0.5", () => {
  return expect(doTask(1, 0.5)).rejects.toBe("Task 1 rejected")
})
```

### Using Async/Await

The `async/await` syntax simplifies working with promises, allowing us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style.

With `async/await`, we use await to pause execution until the promise resolves, and then we run our matcher:

```javascript
test("task resolves if value < 0.5", async () => {
  const data = await doTask(1, 0.3)
  expect(data).toBe("Task 1 resolved")
})
```

When testing for rejection, use a `try/catch` block to handle the error and validate it. Again, include `expect.assertions(n)` to avoid false positives:

```javascript
test("task rejects if value >= 0.5", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1)
  try {
    await doTask(1, 0.5)
  } catch (err) {
    expect(err).toBe("Task 1 rejected")
  }
})
```

### Using callbacks

Testing with callbacks is less common today due to the widespread adoption of promises and async/await, but it’s still useful for legacy codebases or specific APIs.

In [Testing Asynchronously Thrown Errors in Javascript](/js-testing-asynchronously-thrown-errors), I explained that `try/catch` only works for synchronous logic. For asynchronous callbacks, you need to pass a `done` argument to the test and call it when the test is complete.

The [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/asynchronous#callbacks) provides a helpful example of testing asynchronous callbacks. Note that omitting the `done` callback causes the test to finish before the asynchronous operation completes:

```javascript
// Incorrect: Test finishes before callback is invoked
test("the data is peanut butter", () => {
  function callback(error, data) {
    if (error) {
      throw error
    }
    expect(data).toBe("peanut butter")
  }

  fetchData(callback)
})
```

To fix this, we explicitly call `done`:

```javascript
// Correct: Jest waits until done is called
test("the data is peanut butter", (done) => {
  function callback(error, data) {
    if (error) {
      done(error)
      return
    }
    try {
      expect(data).toBe("peanut butter")
      done()
    } catch (error) {
      done(error)
    }
  }

  fetchData(callback)
})
```

We can apply this pattern to test `doTask` with callbacks:

```javascript
test("task resolves if value < 0.5", (done) => {
  function callback(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      done(err)
      return
    }
    try {
      expect(data).toBe("Task 1 resolved")
      done()
    } catch (err) {
      done(err)
    }
  }
  doTask(1, 0.3, callback)
})
```

To enable callback-based testing, we need to tweak the `doTask` function to support callbacks:

```javascript
function doTask(taskNumber, randomNumber, callback) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (randomNumber < 0.5) resolve(`Task ${taskNumber} resolved`)
      else reject(`Task ${taskNumber} rejected`)
    }, randomNumber * 5000)
  })
    .then((data) => callback(null, data))
    .catch((err) => callback(err, null))
}
```

## Conclusion

Testing asynchronous code in JavaScript requires understanding how promises, `async/await`, and callbacks work. Each approach has its strengths:

- Promises: Ideal for direct promise handling with concise syntax.
- Async/await: Simplifies promise-based code into a synchronous style.
- Callbacks: Necessary for legacy code or APIs using callback patterns.

By choosing the right technique for your testing scenario, you can ensure reliable and robust tests for your asynchronous logic.
