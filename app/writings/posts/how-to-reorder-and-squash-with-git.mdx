When working with multiple WIP commits or other related commits, you may want to combine them to keep your Git history clean and organized.

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps to reorder your commits (if necessary) and then squash them into a single commit.

## Step 1: Identify Relevant Commits

First, check your Git commit history to determine how many commits back you need to go in the next step:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

This will output something like:

```bash
pick abc123 [WIP] Initial work on a cool feature
pick def456 Fixed unrelated bug
pick ghi789 [WIP] Fixed a bug in cool feature
pick jkl012 [WIP] Improved UI for cool feature
```

In this case, we want to combine the three WIP commits into one while leaving the unrelated bug fix (`def456`) untouched. Since four commits are involved, we need to go four commits back in the next step.

## Step 2: Rebase Interactively

Run the following command to rebase the last four commits:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

This will open an interactive editor where you can reorder and squash commits.

## Step 3: Reorder Commits (If Necessary)

If your related commits are already consecutive, you can skip this step.

However, in our example, the unrelated commit (`def456`) is in between, so we need to move it below the WIP commits.

### How to Move Commits in Vim

- Navigate to the commit you want to move.
- Press `dd` to cut it.
- Move your cursor to the line above which you want to paste the commit.
- Press `Shift + p` to paste it.

**Before Reordering**:

```bash
pick abc123 [WIP] Initial work on a cool feature
pick def456 Fixed unrelated bug
pick ghi789 [WIP] Fixed a bug in cool feature
pick jkl012 [WIP] Improved UI for cool feature
```

**After Reordering**:

```bash
pick abc123 [WIP] Initial work on a cool feature
pick ghi789 [WIP] Fixed a bug in cool feature
pick jkl012 [WIP] Improved UI for cool feature
pick def456 Fixed unrelated bug
```

Now, all the WIP commits are together, making them easier to squash.

## Step 4: Squash Commits

Next, change the `pick` keyword to `squash` for the second and third WIP commits while leaving the first one as `pick`:

**Before Squashing**:

```bash
pick abc123 [WIP] Initial work on a cool feature
pick ghi789 [WIP] Fixed a bug in cool feature
pick jkl012 [WIP] Improved UI for cool feature
pick def456 Fixed unrelated bug
```

**After Squashing**:

```bash
pick abc123 [WIP] Initial work on a cool feature
squash ghi789 [WIP] Fixed a bug in cool feature
squash jkl012 [WIP] Improved UI for cool feature
pick def456 Fixed unrelated bug
```

Press `Esc` and then type `:wq` to save and exit

## Step 5: Write the New Commit Message

Git will now ask you to provide a new commit message. By default, it will list all commit messages from the squashed commits. Edit this message to keep only the final meaningful message, then save and exit with `:wq`.

## Final Thoughts

Now, your Git history is cleaner, with a single commit for your feature instead of multiple WIP commits.

If you run:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You should see:

```bash
xyz999 feat: Implement cool feature
def456 Fixed unrelated bug
```

### Pro Tip: When Things Go Wrong

If you run into issues during rebasing, you can abort and start over with:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

Hope this helps.
