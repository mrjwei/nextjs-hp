In today’s fast-paced world, AI-driven tools are transforming how we learn, work, and manage our daily lives. This project aims to build a versatile AI assistant, starting with an English-speaking tutor. This assistant will offer real-time, conversational learning experiences, with the potential to grow into a multifunctional tool that supports a wide range of tasks. In this post, I’ll walk you through the early stages of the development process, including the app’s goals, requirements, and a basic prototype.

## Goals

### Short-term Goals

- Create an AI English-speaking tutor accessible from any device with internet connectivity.
- Offer users real-time conversational practice in English, simulating human interaction.
- Store conversations in an organized, permanent manner for review and learning reinforcement.

### Long-term Goals

- Expand the app into a multifunctional personal assistant that helps with tasks such as proofreading, scheduling, image generation, and web scraping.
- Automate parts of users’ daily routines to help them focus on high-priority tasks.

## Requirements

- A database to store conversations.
- An intuitive UI that is easy and fun to interact with.
- Functionality to capture speech, transcribe it, and have the AI speak responses.
- Voice control to enhance usability.
- Integration with multiple AI APIs and custom tools to manage various tasks.
- User authentication for personalised experiences.

## A Quick Prototype

To test some of the key features, I built an initial prototype. It includes core functionality like recording and transcribing speech, sending transcripts to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) for processing, and playing back AI responses. The prototype demonstrates the basic conversational flow between the user and the AI tutor, simulating an interactive learning session.

## Next Step

In the next part of this series, I will integrate a database to enable users to perform CRUD operations on conversations, laying the groundwork for a more robust and feature-rich app.
