When developing the [multifunctional AI assistant app](./multifunctional-ai-assistant-1.mdx), I encountered a common dilemma in React: should I use `useState` or `useRef` to manage a piece of logic? In this article, I’ll walk you through my decision process and explain why I opted for `useRef` in a scenario involving user speech transcription.

## The Context

The app has two key buttons: a **play/stop toggle button** and a **reset button**. Here’s the desired behavior:

- When the user presses the stop button, their speech is transcribed and displayed in a text box.
<br/>
<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/choosing-between-usestate-and-useref-in-react/record-and-stop.gif"
    alt="pressing stop button"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Pressing stop button</figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

- When the reset button is pressed, the recording is cleared and not sent for transcription, since transcription costs both time and money.
<br/>
<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/choosing-between-usestate-and-useref-in-react/record-and-reset.gif"
    alt="pressing reset button"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Pressing reset button</figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>

However, both buttons stop the recording, so I needed a way to distinguish which button triggered the stop action. This would determine whether or not the transcription should occur.

## React Mic and Recording

I used the [react-mic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mic) library to handle speech recording. The library captures the user’s speech and provides it as an audio blob. Typically, you use the component like this:

```javascript
<ReactMic
  record={isRecording}
  onStop={handleStop}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

When `isRecording` is set to `false`, the recording stops and `handleStop` is triggered, receiving the audio blob as an argument.

```javascript
const handleStop = (returnedBlob) => {
  // Process the blob
}
```

Since both the stop and reset buttons stop the recording, I needed a way to determine if the transcription should happen. This led to the decision between `useState` and `useRef`.

## The Problem: To Transcribe or Not to Transcribe?

I wanted to set a flag (`shouldTranscribe`) that would:

1. Trigger transcription only when the stop button is pressed.
2. Prevent transcription when the reset button is clicked.

The core issue is that both buttons set the recording state to `false`, which in turn triggers `handleStop`. To avoid sending the recording for transcription when the reset button is pressed, I needed a flag that could differentiate between the two actions.

## Key Considerations

1. **Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders**
   - `useState` triggers a component re-render whenever its value is updated. This behavior is unnecessary here because changing `shouldTranscribe` doesn’t affect the UI. It’s a purely logical decision: whether or not to send the recording for transcription.
   - On the other hand, `useRef` can hold a mutable value without triggering a re-render. This makes it perfect for managing non-UI-related logic like a flag that determines whether transcription should happen.

2. **Immediate Access to the Updated Value**
   `useState` updates are asynchronous, meaning that if I used `useState` to toggle `shouldTranscribe`, the new value wouldn’t be immediately available during the stop event handling. In contrast, `useRef` provides immediate access to the updated value, which is essential for making synchronous decisions, like whether to transcribe the audio.

## The Final Solution

Here’s the solution I implemented using `useRef`:

```javascript
const shouldTranscribeRef = useRef(false)

const handleStart = () => {
  setIsRecording(true)
}

const handleStop = () => {
  shouldTranscribeRef.current = true // Transcription will happen
  setIsRecording(false)
}

const handleReset = () => {
  shouldTranscribeRef.current = false // No transcription
  setIsRecording(false)
  // Other code omitted
}

const handleTranscribe = async (returnedBlob) => {
  if (shouldTranscribeRef.current) {
    // Send the blob for transcription
  }
}

return (
  <div>
    <ReactMic
      record={isRecording}
      onStop={handleTranscribe}
      {...otherProps}
    />
    {isRecording ? (
      <button onClick={handleStop}>
        Stop
      </button>
    ) : (
      <button onClick={handleStart}>
        Play
      </button>
    )}
    <button onClick={handleReset}>
      Send
    </button>
  </div>
)
```

This way, I managed to achieve the designed behaviour shown in [The Context](#the-context) section.

## Conclusion

In this case, using `useRef` was a better fit than `useState` because it:

- Avoided unnecessary re-renders.
- Provided immediate access to the updated value.

This pattern worked well in my AI assistant app, where I needed to manage non-UI logic efficiently. When deciding between `useState` and `useRef`, consider whether you need reactivity (in which case `useState` is appropriate) or just an instance variable (where `useRef` is better suited).
