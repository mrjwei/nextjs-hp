In this part, I'll share the design strategy and key decisions I implemented to make [**Perfmate**](https://github.com/mrjwei/perfmate) a truly useful and convenient time-tracking tool.

## The Big Picture

I started the design process by asking a critical question:

> What does an app look like that I would actually want to use?

This brought me back to the goals I defined in the previous part:

- **Clean and organized layout**: Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to scan.
- **Refined information hierarchy**: Prioritize important details so they are clear and accessible.
- **Wage management**: Include features to track and display earnings over time.
- **Enriched productivity tools**: Offer functionality that supports focus and efficiency.
- **Flexibility and personalization**: Allow users to manage records, add or edit entries, and customize settings.

At the same time, I clarified what the app would **NOT** include (at least for now):

- **Features for organizations**, such as:
  - Human resource management
  - Vacation management
  - Tax calculation and declaration
- **Import and export**: Nice to have, but not a priority.
- **Invoice management**: Again, useful but not essential for the first version.
- **User registration**: With a free database plan imposing capacity limitations, user registration is deferred until commercialization.
- **Project management**: Perfmate is a time-tracking app, not a project management tool.

Defining both the inclusions and exclusions helped me focus on the core functionality, keeping the scope realistic and achievable. With this clarity, I was in a strong position to get started.

## Getting The Basics Right

One principle I consistently follow in design projects is to **get the basics right**.

Diving headfirst into complex requirements can quickly become overwhelming, so I prioritized a few fundamental aspects. I reasoned that if I could achieve the following, the app would already deliver a solid experience:

- **Easy-to-navigate layout**: Respect natural and habitual scanning patterns to improve user experience while reducing eye strain.

    width="400px"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />

<br/>

- **Intuitive controls and actions**: Focus on the most important actions for each page while limiting unnecessary options to reduce cognitive overload.

    width="400px"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />

<br/>

- **Organized information**: Display the bare minimum necessary information in the right place, at the right time, and in the most accessible style.

<br/>
<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/series/perfmate/info-organization.png"
    alt="Intuitive controls and actions"
    width="600px"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />

## Rapid, Low-fidelity and Frequent Prototyping

Frequent prototyping has been a cornerstone of my design approach. This strategy is particularly effective because:

- It prioritizes action over overthinking, allowing me to kick off a project quickly.
- It provides more opportunities for feedback, learning, and iteration.
- It helps me focus on what’s truly important while ignoring distractions.
- Low-fidelity prototypes are easier, faster, and cheaper to adjust.

<br/>
<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/series/perfmate/sketches.png"
    alt="Back-of-the-napkin sketches"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />

<br/>

By keeping prototypes low-fidelity, I could iterate rapidly and refine the design incrementally, staying agile throughout the process.

## What is Next

In this part, I outlined my design strategy, focusing on getting the basics right and prioritizing rapid, low-fidelity prototyping to refine the user experience.

In the next part, I’ll dive into **color usage** as a case study, sharing how I applied colors thoughtfully in Perfmate to enhance usability, improve scanning, and reduce cognitive load.
