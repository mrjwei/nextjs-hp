Lately, I’ve been captivated by character design, so I set out to challenge myself by creating a diverse range of characters, drawing inspiration from various sources.

I’m especially proud of this piece—not just because the final result turned out well, but because the process taught me so much. For instance, I learned how to depict dirt and sand in a way that harmonizes with the overall style of my illustration. By studying photos of dirt and sand, abstracting their contours and details, and refining these abstractions repeatedly, I was able to achieve a satisfying result.

<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/gold-hunt/dirt-sand-1.jpg"
    alt="illustration of Gold Hunt: dirt and sand 1"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px", maxWidth: "500px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Dirt and sand: 1</figcaption>
</figure>
<br/>
<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/gold-hunt/dirt-sand-2.jpg"
    alt="illustration of Gold Hunt: dirt and sand 1"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px", maxWidth: "500px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Dirt and sand: 2</figcaption>
</figure>

Another challenge was working within the limited space available for Captain Alex’s hands. While maintaining a natural look, I had to strike the right balance between abstraction and realism. Through experimentation, I discovered that switching from rounded corners to mitre joints made it easier to add details like shadows and highlights effectively.

<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/gold-hunt/hands.jpg"
    alt="illustration of Gold Hunt: evolution of hands"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px", maxWidth: "500px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Gold Hunt: evolution of hands</figcaption>
</figure>

Here are the final characters and the completed composition.
