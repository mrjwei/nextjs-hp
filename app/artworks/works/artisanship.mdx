This is an experimental vector illustration inspired by the American pop-art style. I focused on creating impact by exaggerating the characterâ€™s body proportions and emphasizing bold, expressive facial features. The design plays with visual imbalance to evoke a striking and dynamic aesthetic.

<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/artisanship/main.png"
    alt="illustration of artisanship"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px", maxWidth: "500px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Artisanship</figcaption>
</figure>
