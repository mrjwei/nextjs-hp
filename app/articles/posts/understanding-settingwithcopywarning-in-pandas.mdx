When working with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), you may encounter the `SettingWithCopyWarning`, such as in this example:

When I first saw it, I could not figure out what it meant, so I did some research to gain insight. In this article, I'll share my findings to help you understand the warning, its cause and how to prevent it.

## Starting With Questions

The [official Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#why-does-assignment-fail-when-using-chained-indexing) gives this example:

```python
dfmi['one']['second'] = value
# becomes
dfmi.__getitem__('one').__setitem__('second', value)
```

It explains:

> See that `__getitem__` in there? Outside of simple cases, it’s very hard to predict whether it will return a view or a copy (it depends on the memory layout of the array, about which pandas makes no guarantees), and therefore whether the `__setitem__` will modify `dfmi` or a temporary object that gets thrown out immediately afterward. That’s what `SettingWithCopy` is warning you about!

This explanation raised three questions for me:

1. What is a **view** vs. a **copy** in pandas?
2. What is **memory layout** of arrays, and how does it affect whether pandas creates a view or a copy?
3. What does the **temporary object** look like, and why can’t pandas guarantee that modifying it affects the original `dfmi`?

## Finding Answers

### What is a view vs. a copy in pandas?

- **View**: A view is a reference to the original data. Modifying a view modifies the original object because the view doesn’t create a new data object—it simply provides an alternative way to access the same underlying data.
- **Copy**: A copy creates a new, independent object that duplicates the data from the original. Modifying a copy does not affect the original object.

### What is memory layout of arrays, and how does it affect whether pandas creates a view or a copy?

If you slice or index a DataFrame, sometimes you get a view, and other times you get a copy. Pandas tries to optimize memory usage, so the result depends on the operation and the **memory layout** of the data.

The memory layout of arrays refers to how data is stored in memory. In pandas, the underlying data structure is a [NumPy](https://NumPy.org/) array, whose memory layout plays a crucial role:

- **Contiguous Arrays**: Data is stored sequentially in memory. Operations on such arrays often create views, as the data can be accessed efficiently without duplication.
- **Non-Contiguous Arrays**: Data is scattered in memory. Operations on these arrays often create copies to avoid the complexity of mapping scattered elements back to their original locations.

### What does the temporary object look like, and why can’t pandas guarantee that modifying it affects the original `dfmi`?

Consider the example:

```python
dfmi['one']['second'] = value
# Translates to
temp = dfmi.__getitem__('one') # May be a view or a copy
temp.__setitem__('second', value) # Modifying temp does not guarantee that dfmi is modified
```

Here, the intermediate object (temp) could be:

- A view, in which case modifying temp affects `dfmi`.
- A copy, in which case modifications to temp don’t affect `dfmi`.

Because pandas cannot predict whether temp will be a view or a copy, it raises the `SettingWithCopyWarning`.

## Strided Slicing vs. Fancy Indexing

### Strided Slicing: Efficient and Predictable Views

Strided slicing refers to selecting elements at regular intervals, such as every `nth` element:

```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
view = arr[::2]  # Select every 2nd element
```

NumPy can return a view because it calculates element positions using simple arithmetic (start, stop, and stride).

### Fancy Indexing: Complex and Requires Copies

[Fancy indexing](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.07-fancy-indexing.html) selects arbitrary elements, often scattered in memory:

```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
fancy = arr[[0, 2, 4]]  # Arbitrary indices
```

This creates a copy because:

1. The elements are non-contiguous.
2. Maintaining a mapping for changes would be computationally expensive, especially for overlapping or repeated indices.

Example of ambiguity:

```python
arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
fancy = arr[[0, 0, 2]]  # Overlapping indices
fancy[0] = 99 # How should arr handle overlapping indices?
```

## Avoiding the SettingWithCopyWarning

To avoid the warning, always be explicit:

### Modify the Original Data

```python
dfmi.loc[:, ('one', 'second')] = value # Modify the original data
```

### Work with Explicit Copies

```python
temp = dfmi['one'].copy()
temp['second'] = value # Modify the copy
```

## Conclusion

The `SettingWithCopyWarning` indicates that ambiguity exists when modifying data in pandas. Whether a view or a copy is returned depends on factors like the memory layout and the type of indexing used. Understanding these nuances helps ensure our code behaves as expected.

By being explicit about our intentions—either modifying the original data or creating a copy—we can avoid this warning and write clearer, more predictable pandas code.
