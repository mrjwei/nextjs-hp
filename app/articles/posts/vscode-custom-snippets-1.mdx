VSCode is packed with handy features, many of which remain underutilized by developers. In this article, I’ll show you how to leverage the [custom snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) feature to drastically improve your productivity.

## What Are Custom Snippets?

Custom snippets are reusable code templates that you define in configuration files. A typical snippet object contains the following fields:

- **prefix**: The trigger keyword for the snippet.
- **body**: A string or array of strings representing the generated code.
- **description**: A short explanation of what the snippet does.

Although the snippet object supports additional fields like *scope*, they are rarely used and won’t be covered in this article.

## How to Create Custom Snippets

Creating custom snippets is easy. Open the Command Palette with **Cmd + Shift + P** on Mac or **Ctrl + Shift + P** on Windows and type *“custom snippets”* in the search bar. Select **Snippets: Configure Snippets** from the menu. Next, choose the appropriate configuration file for your target file type. For example, to define snippets for `.tsx` files, select `typescriptreact.json`.

Here’s an example of a basic custom snippet defined in `typescriptreact.json`:

```json
"Print to console": {
    "prefix": "log",
    "body": [
        "console.log('$1');",
        "$2"
    ],
    "description": "Log output to console"
},
```

Notice that the `body` field is an array of strings. This allows the snippet to span multiple lines, with each line as a separate string in the array.

Now, open a `.tsx` file and start typing `log`. A menu will appear, showing the snippet’s description (“Print to console”). Select it, input your message, hit Tab, and you’re done!

<figure style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img

    alt="using the basic snippet"
    style={{ marginBottom: "8px" }}
  />
  <figcaption>Using the basic snippet</figcaption>
</figure>

### Placeholders

In the body of the snippet above, you might have noticed some numbers preceded by dollar signs, like $1 and $2. These are called placeholders, and they are the key to the magic of custom snippets. With a bit of creativity, placeholders can turn your snippets into powerful productivity boosters.

A placeholder can take one of two forms:

1. **Simple Placeholders**: A dollar sign followed by a number, e.g., $1 or $2. These mark the spots where the cursor will stop for input during snippet expansion.
2. **Placeholders with Default Text**: A dollar sign followed by curly braces containing a number and some default text separated by a colon, e.g., `${1:ComponentName}`.
    - The number still acts as the index (as with simple placeholders).
    - The text (e.g., `ComponentName`) provides a pre-filled value or a helpful hint for users of the snippet. This text can be overwritten, and any changes will automatically update mirrored placeholders with the same index.

The number in a placeholder defines its **index**. When you expand the snippet, the cursor automatically navigates through placeholders in order, starting with `$1`, then `$2`, and so on.

For example, in the animation:

- After the snippet expanded, the cursor was positioned in the parentheses (`$1`), ready for input.
- Pressing the `Tab` key moved the cursor to the next placeholder (`$2`), enabling you to edit the next part of the code.

This seamless navigation is one of the key reasons custom snippets can save so much time!
